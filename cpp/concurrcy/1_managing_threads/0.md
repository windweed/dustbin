In this chapter, I'll start by covering the basics: launching a thread, waiting  
for it to finish, or running it in the background.

We'll then look at passing additional parameters to the thread function when  
it's launched and how to transfer ownership of a thread from one `std::thread`  
object to another.

Finally, we'll look at choosing the number of threads to use and identifying  
particular threads.
